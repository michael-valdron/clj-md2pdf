# clj-md2pdf

A Clojure powered CLI tool and library for performing moderately complex Markdown to PDF document generation. A great 
tool for those who desire simple semi-programmatic document creation. Store your content in Markdown, style your 
document with CSS / fonts, set your document properties with readable EDN files.

# Requirements

You need to install the **JRE 1.8+** in order to run this tool. For 
development it is expected you have **JDK 1.8+** and a **build tool** 
*(i.e. Leiningen or Clojure 1.9+)*. You will need **Leiningen** to 
directly work and/or contribute to this project.

# Installation
## CLI Tool
1. Download the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/michael-valdron/clj-md2pdf/releases).
2. Unzip the JAR file to a location to store the binary.

You can now try a run by doing:
```
java -jar /path/to/clj-md2pdf-<version>.jar /path/to/output/pdf /path/to/markdown/file(s)
```
You can also create an alias for `java -jar /path/to/clj-md2pdf-<version>.jar` so this can be used more conveniently with the CLI. The way to
achieve depends on the OS you are using.

**Linux**
```sh
# Add to your .<shell>rc, e.g. .bashrc if you are using bash
alias clj-md2pdf='java -jar /path/to/clj-md2pdf-<version>.jar'
```

## Library

### Dependency

Planning on releasing to [clojars.org](https://clojars.org/) repositories
in the near future, so stay tuned!

### Git

**Note**: You will need Leiningen for this method of installing.

First clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/michael-valdron/clj-md2pdf.git):
```
git clone https://github.com/michael-valdron/clj-md2pdf.git
```
Fetch dependencies by:
```
lein deps
```
To package up in JAR for library use do the following:
```
lein jar
```
You can install this locally to your `~/.m2` directory for regular
dependency use in your Clojure projects by performing the following:
```
lein install
```

# Usage

## CLI Tool

The usage section I will assume an `alias` named `clj-md2pdf`, if you
are using `java -jar /path/to/clj-md2pdf-<version>.jar` just replace
`clj-md2pdf` with this.

To render a simple Markdown into a PDF perform the following:
```
clj-md2pdf output/pdf markdown/file
```

You can use multiple Markdown files too:
```
clj-md2pdf output/pdf markdown/file1 markdown/file2 ...
```
**Note**: When passing multiple Markdown files keep in mind that
the order that you specify these files is the same order that they
are rendered in the PDF file.
